limitations in this  Section 3.3 apply  equally to your  use of the  Product, in
whole or in part, including any component or Redistributable. 

3.4  LIMITED  WARRANY  AND  DISCLAMER:  Omondo  warrants  to  you,  the original
purchaser and  to no  other party,  that any  physical media  included with  the
Product,  as and  when provided  to you,  will be  free of  physical defects  in
materials and workmanship for a period  of ninety (90) days after the  date that
you initially  acquire the  Product.  This  warranty does  not apply  to damages
resulting  from  misuse,  abuse  or  neglect.   Any  replacement  media  will be
warranted as above for the remainder  of the original warranty period or  twenty
(20) days from the date we ship it to you, whichever is longer.  Except for this
express limited warranty, the product  is provided "as is" and  without warranty
of any  kind.  Omondo  hereby excludes  and disclaims  all implied  or statutory
warranties,  including  any  warranties   of  merchantability,  fitness  for   a
particular purpose, quality, non-infringement, title, results, efforts or  quiet
enjoyment.  There is  no warranty that  the product will  be error-free or  will
function  without interruption.   You assume  the entire  risk for  the results
obtained using  the product.   To the  extent that  omondo may  not disclaim any
warranty as a matter of applicable law, the scope and duration of such  warranty
will be the minimum permitted under such law. 

3.5  SERVICES,  UPDATES, PRODUCT  CHANGES.  Omondo is  not  required under  this
License Agreement  to provide  any installation,  training or  other services to
you.  Such services, if available,  must be purchased separately.  If,  pursuant
to a separate  support agreement or  otherwise, Omondo provides  you with a  new
release, error correction, update, upgrade or other modification to the Product,
such modification will be deemed part  of the Product, and subject to  the terms
of this License Agreement, unless the modification is expressly provided subject
to a separate license  agreement. Omondo reserves the  right at any time  not to
release or to discontinue release of any Product and to alter prices,  features,
specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates, general
availability or other characteristics 
of any future releases of the Product. 

3.6 REGISTRATION. You must  register the Product with  Omondo as a condition  to
your rights to use the Product.  You will be prompted to register the Product at
the time of  your installation or  first use of  the Product, at  which time you
will be notified (or directed  to online resources explaining) how  registration
information provided by you may be used and you will be afforded the opportunity
to opt out of certain uses of such information. 

3.7  CONFIDENTIALITY.  You acknowledge  that  the Product  in  source code  form
remains  a  confidential  trade  secret  of  Omondo.   You  agree  to  hold this
information in confidence, not disclose it to any person, and not use it for any
purpose other than the use and operation of the Product as permitted under  this
License Agreement. 

3.8 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. In no event will omondo be liable to any party  for
any indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary, special or punitive damages,
including any  loss of  profit, revenue,  business opportunity  or data, arising
from or relating to this license agreement or the product, whether in  contract,
in tort, negligence or otherwise, even if omondo knew, should have known or  has
been advised  of the  possibility of  such damages.   Omondo's total  cumulative
liability arising  from or  related to  this license  agreement or  the product,
whether in contract, in tort or otherwise, will not exceed the fees paid for one
mobile  license.   This section  3.8  will apply  even  if an  exclusive  remedy
hereunder has  failed of  its essential  purpose. Some  states do  not allow the
exclusion or  limitation of  incidental or  consequential damages,  so the above
limitation or exclusion 
may not apply to you. 

3.9 THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.  Omondo will defend and settle any suit brought  against
you by  a third  party (not  your affiliate)  based on  a claim that the Product
infringes upon any E.E.C copyright and  Omondo will pay those costs and  damages
finally awarded against you in  such suit that are specifically  attributable to
such claims or those amounts payable by you under a settlement of such suit. The
foregoing obligations are conditioned on you:  (a) notifying Omondo promptly  in
writing of such action;  (b) giving Omondo sole  control of the defense  thereof
and  any  related  settlement negotiations;  (c)  cooperating  and, at  Omondo's
request and expense, assisting  in such defense. If  the Product becomes, or  in
Omondo's opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim  that
Omondo  is required  to defend,  then Omondo  may (at  its option  and  expense)
either:   (a) procure  for you  the right  to continue  using the  Product;  (b)
replace or modify the Product  so that it becomes non-infringing;  (c) terminate
this License  Agreement. Notwithstanding   the foregoing,  Omondo will  have  no
obligation   under  this   Section  10   or  otherwise   with  respect   to  any
infringement claim based  upon:  (a) any  use of the  Product not in  accordance
with this License Agreement or the Product's accompanying documentation: (b) any
use of the Product in  combination with other products, equipment,  software, or
data not provided  by Omondo; (c)  any use of  any version of  the Product other
than the most current version made available to you; (d) any modification of the
Product by  any person  other than  Omondo or  its authorized  agents ("Excluded
Claims"). You  will indemnify  Omondo against  all liability,  damages and costs

provisions of this License Agreement with  the exception of the Scope of  Use in
Sections 2, will survive termination of this License Agreement for any reason.

 organization), during the term of this License and for one (1) year thereafter,
 Omondo or its outside auditors will have the right to conduct an audit of  your

 connection with  any application  requiring fail-safe  performance such  as the
 operation  of  nuclear  power facilities,  air  traffic  control or  navigation
 systems, weapons  control systems,  life support  systems, or  any other system
 whose  failure  could  lead  to injury,  death,  environmental  damage  or mass
 destruction.  You agree that Omondo will  have no liability of any nature,  and
 you are solely responsible, for any expense, loss, injury or damage incurred as
 a result of such  use of the Product.  You may not transfer  the Product media,
 assign this License Agreement or assign  any of your rights or delegate  any of
 your obligations under this License Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise
 (including by merger, sale of assets or consolidation), without Omondo's  prior
 written  consent. You  may not  directly or  indirectly transfer  the  Product,
 including  its  documentation,  to  any  country  if  such  transfer  would  be

 Administration Act  and the  regulations issued  thereunder. You  agree to  the
 foregoing and you are representing and warranting that you are not located  in,
 under the control of, or a national  or resident of any such country. You  will
 be  solely responsible  for identifying  and complying  with all  laws of   any
 jurisdiction outside of the United  States or EEC regarding the  import, export
 or use of Products  and technical data supplied  by Omondo. You will  obtain at
 your own expense all licenses, permits or approvals required by any  government
 to use the Product. 

6. GOVERNING LAW. This  License Agreement will be  governed by and construed  in
accordance  with  the  laws of  the  French  country and  the  Paris  Chamber of
Commerce, without giving  effect to any  conflicts or choice  of laws principles
that would require the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction.  The
parties expressly exclude the application of the 1980 United Nations  Convention
on the International Sale of Goods (if applicable).
