            <question>Installing the IDE</question>
            <answer>
                <p>You can download Eclipse Classic latest version 
                from http://eclipse.org/downloads. Eclipse is shipped 
                as a compressed archive, and installation is a simple matter 
                of unzipping them anywhere on your local machine. 
                You will need to first install Java Development Kit (JDK) 
                to use Eclipse.</p>

        <faq id="Installing plug-in for accessing source code repository">
            <question>Installing plug-in for accessing source code repository</question>
            <answer>
                <p>Provisioner project uses SourceForge's Subversion reposiroty for 
                source control purposes. In order to check-out and commit changes to
                Provisioner's repository you have to install an Eclipse Subversion
                plugin. Go to Eclipse's software update window 
                (i.e., Help->Software Updates->Find and Install) and add a new 
                update site by entering the URL: "http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.2.x". This will 
                automatically install Subclipse plug-in (Note: Select "Subclipse Plugin" 
                and leave out "Integrations" when selecting features to install). You may get
                a feature verification warning complaining that you are installing
                an unsigned feature, you just have to ignore this warning.</p>

        <faq id="Downloading Provisioner's source code">
            <question>Downloading Provisioner's source code</question>
            <answer>
                <p>Instructions on how to download project's source code as 
                a developer from the command line, can be found at
                http://identitymngr.sourceforge.net/source-repository.html.
                
                On the other hand, if you want to download project's source
                code from within Eclipse you will have to create a new project
                selecting "Checkout Projects from SVN" wizard in "New Project" 
                window (i.e., File->New->Project). This will create a new project by 
                checking out an existing project from a SVN repository. If you are 
                connecting to SourceForge's SVN server for the first time you will
                need to create a new SVN repository by typing 
                "https://identitymngr.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/identitymngr/"
                when asked for new SVN repository URL. If you are going to work
                in the development mainline checkout from the trunk folder, 
                if what you are planning to do is do bug fixing on an official
                release (e.g. version 1.0.18) you should checkout from the
                branches folder selecting the particular release 
                (e.g. ~/branches/Provisioner-1.0.18).
                You might get an error stating that the certificate issuer is 
                unknown, ignore the error by clicking the "Accept Permanently"
                button. Eclipse will start downloading Provisioner's source code.

        <faq id="Installing plug-in for compiling source code">
            <question>Installing plug-in for compiling source code</question>
            <answer>
                <p>In order to be able to compile from within Eclipse install Maven2 
                plug-in. Go to Eclipse's software update window (i.e., Help->Software Updates->Find and Install) and add a new 
                update site by entering the URL: "http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/update/". 
                This will automatically install Maven2 plug-in (Note: Select "Maven Integration" and leave  
                out "Optional Components" when selecting features to install).
                
                Once you have Maven2 installed you will be able to compile 
                Provisioner by right-clicking pom.xml file and selecting 
                "Maven2 Build" from the "Run As" option. To learn more about 
                Maven goto http://maven.apache.org.</p>
