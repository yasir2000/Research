How to run Provisioner
    
  Before you run the Provisioner you have to check for the existence of java 
  runtime JRE 1.5 or higher, and 
  {{{howto-install.html}create the operation's queue}} in your RDBMS. 
    
* Starting the Provisioner 

  To start the Provisioner you have to execute the following command: 

  <<<~/Provisioner/Provisioner.sh start>>>
  
  This will check if Provisioner is already running. If not, it will 
  launch a new instance of the Provisioner using the parameters configured
  in ~Provisioner/Provisioner.cfg.  

* Stopping the Provisioner 

  To stop the Provisioner you have to execute the following command: 

  <<<~/Provisioner/Provisioner.sh stop>>> 

  This will check if Provisioner is running and send it a stop signal if 
  it is running.
  
* Verifying current Provisioner's status

  To check whether the Provisioner system is running correctly or not
  you have to execute the following command: 

  <<<~/Provisioner/Provisioner.sh status>>> 

  This will check if Provisioner is running and show its process ID if it
  is running.
  
* Re-loading provisioning rules

  If you have changed provisioning rules and want Provisioner to refresh
  its internal copy of them, execute the following command>

  <<<~/Provisioner/Provisioner.sh refresh>>>  
  
  This will check if Provisioner is running and send it a refresh signal if
  it is running. The Provisioner will then re-read and load rules, routes, 
  responses and services configurations.
  
* Modifying Provisioner's launch parameters

  Provisioner requires 5 parameters to start running. This parameters
  allows you to tune Provisioner's execution. Note that the position
  of each parameter is relevant:
  
  * #1: Interval, in seconds, for searching new pending provisioning requirements (e.g. 60).
  
  * #3: Specify the maximum amount of consumer threads to be created (e.g. 4).
  
  * #2: Specify where the configuration files are stored (e.g. ~/Provisioner/conf).
  
  * #4: Specify country for the log and debug messages (e.g. US).
  
  * #5: Specify language for the log and debug messages (e.g. en). 
  
  The value for these parameters should be configured in 
  ~Provisioner/Provisioner.cfg.
